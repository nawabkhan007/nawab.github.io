             <li>Someone tried to assassinate Teddy Roosevelt by shooting him in the chest,<dd> but he survived because his CHEST WAS TOO HEAVILY MUSCLED FOR THE BULLET TO GET THROUGH.<br>
               Then he went on to give a scheduled campaign speech. And nothing is <br> sexier than a man giving a speech while covered in blood. br</dd></li>
